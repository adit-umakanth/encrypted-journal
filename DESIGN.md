# Design Plan

This document is just a collection of design decisions and plans written down before the building of the website and cloud resources. The final software may or may not follow the choices laid out in this document.

## Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools

The software used to build this application have been chosen after some considerable thought along with my personal comfort-level and bias. One main requirement was not needing any sort of continuously running server that would charge a rate based on time. Therefore serverless offerings and NoSQL databases were given more priority.
